:summary: Introducing the new circuits website

Welcome to the new circuits website!

This website has been developed from the ground up to be mobile friendly
for our modern mobile computing lives. The old website was old and outdated
style-wise and was powered by a dynamic and very flexible content management
system that never really got utilized to it's full extend.

This website is using the following technologies:

- `Github`_ -- For storing the content
- `Github Pages`_ -- For the hosting
- `Travis CI`_ -- For automatic builds and deployments
- `Pelican`_ -- For generating the rendered output
- `Bootstrap`_ -- For the look and feel

We will also be providing regular blog posts on the site so if you're interested
in Asynchronous, Event-driven Programming, Component Architectures, Micro-Services,
Distributed Computing, Infrastructure, Orchestration and other topics then please
subscribe to the new and upcoming blog!

We've also added a way for users to contact us directly through the site.
Simply click on the Blue "Help" button that appears in the center on the
left-hand side of every page. Alternatively you can visit our `Support Portal`_
proudly hosted by our friends at `Mojo Helpdesk`_.

Enjoy the new site!

cheers

`James Mills`_
